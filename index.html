                <p id="sectionDescription">
                    Poutine "Middle Name Redacted" Campbell was born on July 1st, 2020. Because she was born on Canada Day and I am a chef, the only logical name I could give her was Poutine. In her first year, Poutine was a little fluffy ball of chaos. This was first evident when she jumped directly into the toilet bowl as a kitten within a month of me having her.
